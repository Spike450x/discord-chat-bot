# <p align="center">Horton Bot</p>

Hello, this is Horton Bot! This bot was created by Joshua Wood for the use of Alpha Phi Omega's Psi Omega Chapters discord. 

Please check out the **demo file** to see the all the bot commands in action.

This bot was written in **JavaScript** and has more than 30 commands.

The **index.js** file is the programs main function. In order for the bot to work, the user must enter a prefix (in this case an '*!*') and then the commands keyword. 

The bots commands are broken down into two categories: fun commands and apo commands (apo standing for Alpha Phi Omega). That way users can get important information from the bot but also have a little bit of fun.

This was a personal project I took on. I am looking forward to new challenges and hope to pursue making a twitter bot for my next project. 

I am always updating and adding new commands to the bot as my fraternity brothers give me suggestions on what they would like to see the bot do. It is fun seeing the brothers enjoy the bot and give me challenges.

Note, this bot does **run on a server** so the fraternity has access to the bot 24 hours a day. Originally, the fraternity could only use the bot if I had the program running from my personal computer, however, after lots of research I was able to host it. Currently, Horton is hosted on *Vultr.com* with a small monthly fee.

Horton bot is a fun chat bot and he is used every day, especially in educating the new members of our organization. So far, there haven't been any problems and I am excited to expand upon what he can do.
